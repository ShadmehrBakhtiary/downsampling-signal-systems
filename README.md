## Project Description
This project focuses on the implementation of an image down-sampling technique using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method in Python and MATLAB. The goal is to explore how the frequency domain representation of an image can be leveraged to efficiently reduce its resolution while preserving essential visual information.

## Methods
The project will delve into the application of FFT to convert images from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, enabling the selective removal of high-frequency components. By strategically subsampling the frequency components and reconstructing the image in the spatial domain, the down-sampling process will be carried out effectively.

## Implementation
The down-sampling technique will be implemented using Python's NumPy and SciPy libraries for FFT processing and image manipulation. Additionally, MATLAB's inbuilt functions for FFT and image processing will be utilized to demonstrate the down-sampling process in an alternative environment. The project will provide detailed, step-by-step implementations in both Python and MATLAB, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the FFT-based down-sampling method.

## Benefits
The FFT-based down-sampling method offers advantages such as reduced computational complexity and improved preservation of image features compared to traditional spatial domain down-sampling techniques. By showcasing the effectiveness of this approach, the project aims to provide a valuable resource for image processing enthusiasts and practitioners seeking efficient down-sampling solutions.

## Future Work
Future work may involve extending the down-sampling technique to handle color images, exploring advanced FFT-based image processing methods, and developing user-friendly tools for visualizing the down-sampling process in real-world applications.
